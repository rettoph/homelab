## Debian Setup Guid
I gave up on Alpine - too many projects depend on packages unique to apk and finding alternatives with apk was getting to be a real pain.

*Note To Self*: When using the cli Debian installer it will eventually ask what to install. "Desktop Environment, GNOME, ect". DO NOT HIT ENTER EXPECTING THAT TO UNCHECK DESKTOP ENVIRONMENT. This will auto continue to the next page and begin installation. Use Spacebar to deselect instead.
